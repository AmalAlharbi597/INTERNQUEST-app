 INTERNQUEST-app
 
Internship opportunities are an essential part of the graduation requirements for students, allowing them to apply what they have learned during their university studies. These opportunities help enhance students' skills and increase their chances of securing future employment, while also providing them with a chance to explore different fields and build valuable professional relationships. However, students often face difficulties in finding suitable companies for internships, which negatively impacts their academic performance and progress toward graduation.

In Saudi Arabia, companies seek to attract talent by offering diverse internship programs in areas such as technology, marketing, and engineering. By fostering connections between students and companies, it becomes easier for students to find opportunities that align with their academic goals and career aspirations.

overview :



 This project involves conducting a thorough business analysis prior to implementing the internship application. The goal is to assess the feasibility and strategic alignment of the application with market needs.
The analysis begins with stakeholder identification, recognizing all parties involved, including students seeking internships, companies offering programs, and the development team. Understanding their needs and expectations is crucial for tailoring the application effectively. Next, a detailed financial cost analysis is performed. This includes estimating development costs, marketing expenses, and ongoing operational costs to ensure that the project is financially viable and aligns with budget constraints. Additionally, the project scope processes are defined to outline the objectives and deliverables clearly. This helps in setting realistic expectations and timelines for the project's execution. Finally, a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is developed, breaking down the project into manageable components. This structured approach allows for better planning and resource allocation, ensuring that all aspects of the project are addressed before moving into the development phase. By conducting this comprehensive business analysis, we aim to minimize risks and enhance the likelihood of a successful application launch that meets the needs of its users.
