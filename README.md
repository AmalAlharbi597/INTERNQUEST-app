 INTERNQUEST-app
Internship opportunities are an essential part of the graduation requirements for students, allowing them to apply what they have learned during their university studies. These opportunities help enhance students' skills and increase their chances of securing future employment, while also providing them with a chance to explore different fields and build valuable professional relationships. However, students often face difficulties in finding suitable companies for internships, which negatively impacts their academic performance and progress toward graduation.

In Saudi Arabia, companies seek to attract talent by offering diverse internship programs in areas such as technology, marketing, and engineering. By fostering connections between students and companies, it becomes easier for students to find opportunities that align with their academic goals and career aspirations.

Goals :
Simplify the process of finding internships for students.
Help companies connect with talented candidates efficiently.
Build a platform that fosters seamless communication and connections between students and companies.
